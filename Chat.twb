              <bucket>&quot;Realize I am in the (single) minority here but R is not applicable to any job that I am aware of in supply chain unless you are a strict data analyst for part of a supply chain. Any sort of ERP software does all of these calcs. SQL can be helpful in certain reporting contexts. 

My point being...I feel like they are setting us up to fail with the shitty teaching, languages they are teaching, specifically for supply chain kids. &quot;</bucket>

Im working with a data set where Im basically trying to see what factors most impact a loan distribution that was given as a range e.g. $500k-1m. I decided to distill that into maximum loan values. At first I was trying to use MLR to write the model, but now Im thinking multinomial logistic regression would be better because those ranges are more like categorical variables at this point.

              <bucket>&quot;Think of it this way

the output cell is doing what?

its opening the file, then saying for every line in this file I want to do this…

i’m going to LOAD the line
find where the location information is on the line
pass that location value into the geostrings.resolve function
Take those values and pass them into the record_location function

your function is going to take those 3 values. Look at each one. Then sort them into dictionaries.

first it will determine if there are any blanks and skip them if there are.
Then it will look at the city value, see if its already in the cities dictionary. If not, it’ll add the key and set the value to 1. If it is in there, it’ll add 1 to the value.

Then the function will do the same for sub countries (state) and countries.

After you complete that list for all the lines in the json, the next function just wants the top cities from that list.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Yes, I would say so. Definitely staff  walking around checking everyone has their mask properly covering mouth and nose. And yes in the main weight room and in the annex room the staff cleans every hour. So they close off those areas every hour and the staff disinfects. It is also mandatory to disinfect before and after using equipment but they also disinfect those areas pretty well. And yes I would say distancing is maintained. &quot;</bucket>

Hi Everyone,

I&apos;ve had a few students express some concerns about the final exam. To address some of the concerns I want to let you all know that there will not be anything on the exam that was not covered in class nor will you be expected to write code from scratch. You will be expected to be able to adapt the code that we used during this course to problems on the exam and perform analysis. As the exam is open book and open note I would recommend having your code from the discussion activities available for your use during the exam. I believe that if you take these steps and study those problems from the review sessions you will be successful on this exam.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;A type two error is called beta (instead of your type one alpha). Remember power = 1 - beta. So the only way to decrease your risk of committing a type 2 error is by increasing your power. 

Your power is essentially the size of your sample. &quot;</bucket>

Thank you for being so unforgettable. I will probably remember thee for the rest of my life. For all of the ups you gave me, though infrequent, I am grateful. For the myriad despairs, I disparage you in turn. To summarize, I am calling it quits with you. 

Sincerely,

Your Ex

He should have had 3 TA&apos;s all along to help, I know of other profs who have 3 TA&apos;s.  The school has pretty much thrown us into a huge freshman style lecture hall w/o enough resources to be successful (at least for those of us where programming is not second nature and have 0 background with it). For the amount of $ we are paying for this it is incredibly disappointing.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Hello everyone.
I will get about 60 minutes of PRE-SYNC lecture material (i.e., videos) posted for WEEK 07 after class tonight. For everyone&apos;s sake, I will teach the same material back-to-back tonight and tomorrow related to updating, deleting rows of data, while also reviewing again INSERT INTO statements and inserting data via CSV files into Workbench. I will post separate, optional tutorials on getting started with AWS RDS and Azure databases later this week.

For the 3 team labs, they will be up tonight and will be due at the end of Week 08.  The discussion posted this week will also be due in Week 8 (i.e., next week) and will involve creating a 2-4 table database sharing your CREATE statements as your &apos;initial post&apos;. Then, to reply to a student, you will insert 1-2 rows of data for each table created by another students as your reply.&quot;</bucket>

              <bucket>&quot;Hi everyone! I am soliciting help. After getting minimal (read: hardly any...) responsiveness/traction with my SQL group (no one in Proj Phoenix is in my group!) for the last 2-3 weeks and no traction with Keith, I have concluded I just need to start on this thing and act as if I am going to need to do the project on my own which is fine. 

However, I am really struggling with finding a dataset. This is not my forte...I am a supply chain gal through and through and can read and interpret outputs well but struggle when I need to actually produce or procure data myself. Can anyone offer any resources and/or suggestions on type of data set (how much qualitative vs quantitative info should it have, does number of rows matter ie does it need to have like thousands and thousands, etc) I will take any and all advice. TIA!&quot;</bucket>
